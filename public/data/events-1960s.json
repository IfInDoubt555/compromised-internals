    "details_html": "<h2 class=\"text-center text-xl font-bold mb-4\">🏁 Overview</h2><p class=\"text-center\">The 1966 Rallye Lyon–Charbonnières stood tall as one of France’s most refined and demanding asphalt rallies. Known for its urban class and countryside chaos, this event tested both poise and pressure. With tight controls, flowing hill roads, and the unpredictability of spring storms, it was an early-season highlight on the ERC calendar. The event’s balance of speed, navigation, and strategy cemented its place as a proving ground for future rally legends.</p>\n<hr class=\"mb-4 mt-4\">\n<h2 class=\"text-center font-bold text-xl mb-4 mt-4\">🗺️ Route Details</h2><p class=\"text-center mb-4\">Starting in the heart of Lyon, the route curved through the Beaujolais hills and the Rhône countryside before finishing ceremonially in Charbonnières-les-Bains. Drivers faced rapidly changing road widths, tight switchbacks bordered by stone walls, and blind rises that punished the inattentive. Several night sections added to the challenge, with damp pavement and poor visibility forcing a more calculated pace.</p><ul class=\"list-disc list-inside\"><li><strong>Total Distance:</strong> ~1,100 kilometers</li><li><strong>Surface:</strong> Urban and rural tarmac with occasional gravel runoff</li><li><strong>Hazards:</strong> Slick spring roads, overgrown corners, and tight village chicanes</li></ul><p class=\"text-center mt-4\">The rally’s pace was relentless, with minimal room for error. Co-driver notes had to be on point—late calls led to bent bumpers or worse.</p>\n<hr class=\"mb-4 mt-4\">\n<h2 class=\"text-center font-bold text-xl mb-4 mt-4\">🏆 Results</h2><p class=\"text-center mb-4\">Jean Vinatier drove a nearly flawless race in the Alpine A110, using the car’s lightness and agility to full advantage on the rally’s tightest stretches. His calculated aggression and consistency earned him a commanding win over French and Nordic challengers.</p><ul class=\"list-disc list-inside\"><li><strong>1st:</strong> Jean Vinatier / Alpine A110</li><li><strong>2nd:</strong> Bernard Consten / Renault R8 Gordini</li><li><strong>3rd:</strong> Pauli Toivonen / Citroën DS</li></ul><p class=\"text-center mt-4\">Consten pushed hard in the mid-stages but struggled with tire wear, while Toivonen’s DS proved steady but less nimble in the narrow hill sections.</p>\n<hr class=\"mb-4 mt-4\">\n<h2 class=\"text-center font-bold text-xl mb-4 mt-4\">🚗 Vehicle Highlights</h2><p class=\"text-center mb-4\">The Lyon–Charbonnières was tailor-made for cars with compact size, quick steering, and superb weight balance. Alpine’s A110 stood out as a technical benchmark, beginning to show signs of the dominance it would later bring to the WRC stage. Renault’s Gordini offered a strong combination of torque and precision, while Citroën’s DS brought comfort and long-distance consistency—but lacked bite in tight turns.</p><ul class=\"list-disc list-inside\"><li><strong>Alpine A110:</strong> Exceptional agility, ideal for short-stage blasts and hairpin sequences</li><li><strong>Renault R8 Gordini:</strong> Punchy and controllable, but heavier than the Alpine in transitions</li><li><strong>Citroën DS:</strong> Stable under braking and excellent in poor conditions, though large for narrow sections</li></ul><p class=\"text-center mt-4\">This rally began to foreshadow a new generation of lightweight, rear-engined tarmac dominators—and the Alpine was leading the charge.</p>\n<hr class=\"mb-4 mt-4\">\n<h2 class=\"text-center font-bold text-xl mb-4 mt-4\">🧭 Navigation and Challenges</h2><p class=\"text-center mb-4\">The 1966 edition was navigation-intensive, with minimal timing tolerance on narrow urban segments and many high-speed direction changes. Co-drivers were kept on edge by quick transitions from open country to constricted village lanes, where being off by even a second could result in time penalties—or worse, missed controls entirely.</p><ul class=\"list-disc list-inside\"><li><strong>Timing Controls:</strong> Plentiful and closely spaced near village zones</li><li><strong>Map Reading:</strong> Complex with multiple route variants and speed average segments</li><li><strong>Pace Strategy:</strong> Winning crews slowed early to avoid overcommitting into critical sections</li></ul><p class=\"text-center mt-4\">The 1966 Rallye Lyon–Charbonnières reminded competitors that rallying wasn’t just about power—it was about patience, teamwork, and knowing when to push and when to preserve. It was a rally of timing, terrain, and tenacity.</p>",

It tested not only speed but also a crew’s ability to adhere to rigid controls and navigate a tightly managed route across the German Democratic Republic.</p>\n<hr class=\"mb-4 mt-4\">\n<h2 class=\"text-center font-bold text-xl mb-4 mt-4\">🗺️ Route Details</h2><p class=\"text-center mb-4\">The rally ran primarily on paved and patched tarmac roads around East Berlin and throughout the surrounding Brandenburg and Saxony regions. Rather than raw stage speed, emphasis was placed on accurate timing, route compliance, and vehicle reliability. Frequent control zones, secret checkpoints, and narrow town roads characterized this endurance test.</p><ul class=\"list-disc list-inside\"><li><strong>Distance:</strong> ~950 km</li><li><strong>Surface:</strong> Mostly tarmac with some worn gravel sectors</li><li><strong>Challenges:</strong> Timecard discipline, surprise time controls, dense urban navigation</li></ul><p class=\"text-center mt-4\">Crews faced pressure not from jumps or hairpins—but from the stopwatch, regulations, and the unforgiving precision of the East German rally system.</p>\n<hr class=\"mb-4 mt-4\">\n<h2 class=\"text-center font-bold text-xl mb-4 mt-4\">🏆 Results</h2><p class=\"text-center mb-4\">Polish legend Sobiesław Zasada, co-driven by Zenon Leszczuk, delivered a composed and tactical victory in a Porsche 911 L. Their mastery of both performance driving and procedural timing overcame the uniquely demanding structure of the Pneumant Rally, earning them a pivotal win in the 1968 European Rally Championship season.</p><ul class=\"list-disc list-inside\"><li><strong>1st:</strong> Sobiesław Zasada / Zenon Leszczuk – Porsche 911 L</li></ul><p class=\"text-center mt-4\">Zasada’s mix of calculated pace and technical reliability proved the ideal match for an event that punished errors more than it rewarded boldness.</p>\n<hr class=\"mb-4 mt-4\">\n<h2 class=\"text-center font-bold text-xl mb-4 mt-4\">🚗 Vehicle Highlights</h2><p class=\"text-center mb-4\">While Zasada’s Porsche 911 L dominated, many local crews piloted East Bloc machinery such as Trabants, Wartburgs, and Škodas. These cars, though slower, performed reliably and were well-suited for the regularity-style scoring system that defined much of the rally's difficulty.</p><ul class=\"list-disc list-inside\"><li><strong>Porsche 911 L:</strong> Agile, powerful, and reliable in mixed conditions—favored by top-tier ERC competitors</li><li><strong>Wartburg 311:</strong> Known for simplicity, solid torque, and endurance under rally conditions</li><li><strong>Trabant 601:</strong> Lightweight and low-maintenance, ideal for regularity sectors</li><li><strong>Škoda 1000 MB:</strong> Rear-engined reliability with strong showing in narrow, twisty terrain</li></ul><p class=\"text-center mt-4\">Top results required not just speed, but a car that could meet checkpoint demands without a breakdown or timing slip.</p>\n<hr class=\"mb-4 mt-4\">\n<h2 class=\"text-center font-bold text-xl mb-4 mt-4\">🧭 Navigation and Challenges</h2><p class=\"text-center mb-4\">Success in the 1968 Pneumant Rally required total synchronicity between driver and co-driver. Navigators had to track time to the second, plot routes using complex roadbooks, and anticipate penalty-prone control zones placed without warning. Long nights and urban sectors made concentration and route discipline essential for survival.</p><ul class=\"list-disc list-inside\"><li><strong>Navigation:</strong> Manual plotting and second-by-second coordination required</li><li><strong>Timing:</strong> Points deducted for even minor checkpoint deviations</li><li><strong>Checkpoints:</strong> Dozens of surprise control stations enforced by strict officials</li></ul><p class=\"text-center mt-4\">The Pneumant Rally wasn’t just won on the road—it was won on the clock. Every moment was a judgment call, and even the smallest miscalculation could prove fatal to a podium run.</p>",
