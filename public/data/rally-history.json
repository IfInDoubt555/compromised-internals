It required finesse and rhythm, rewarding those who could keep it on the edge without scrubbing off speed.</p>\n<hr class=\"mb-4 mt-4\">\n<h2 class=\"text-center text-xl font-bold mb-4 mt-4\">🔧 Legacy & Cultural Impact</h2>\n<p class=\"text-center\">The Mini Cooper S became a British motorsport icon — immortalized not only by its Monte Carlo success, but also by its cultural relevance in films like <em>The Italian Job</em>. It inspired the design of future compact performance cars and remains one of the most beloved rally vehicles of all time. Its David vs. Goliath story is often cited when discussing clever engineering triumphs in motorsport history.</p>",

        "details_html": "\n<h2 class=\"text-center text-xl font-bold mb-4\">🏁 Overview</h2>\n<p class=\"text-center\">The Saab 96, introduced in 1960, was one of rallying’s most rugged and reliable machines of the decade. Developed by the Swedish automaker Saab, it featured a two-stroke engine early on and a later shift to four-stroke V4 power, all wrapped in an aerodynamic body with excellent balance. Its durability and exceptional grip in snowy, icy conditions made it a Scandinavian favorite and a threat in the toughest European rallies.</p>\n<hr class=\"mb-4 mt-4\">\n<h2 class=\"text-center text-xl font-bold mb-4 mt-4\">⚙️ Technical Specs & Innovations</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Engine:</strong> Initially 841cc 2-stroke, later upgraded to 1.5L Ford V4</li>\n<li><strong>Power Output:</strong> ~65–75 hp depending on spec</li>\n  <li><strong>Drivetrain:</strong> Front-wheel drive</li>\n  <li><strong>Weight:</strong> ~880 kg (1,940 lbs)</li>\n  <li><strong>Layout:</strong> Front-engine, FWD with excellent weight distribution</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mt-4 text-center\">The transition to a Ford-sourced V4 in 1967 boosted reliability and torque. Saab engineers emphasized safety, balance, and rugged construction — all crucial for endurance rallying.</p>\n<hr class=\"mb-4 mt-4\">\n<h2 class=\"text-center text-xl font-bold mb-4 mt-4\">🏆 Competitive Highlights</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>1960s Monte Carlo & RAC Rally:</strong> Regular podium contender with Erik Carlsson at the wheel.</li>\n<li><strong>1962 East African Safari Rally:</strong> A brutal terrain victory that highlighted the 96’s toughness.</li>\n  <li><strong>Multiple Swedish Rally Wins:</strong> Dominated winter rallies in its home region.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mt-4 text-center\">Erik Carlsson’s iconic performances helped cement the Saab 96’s place in rallying lore. Its nickname, “Mr. Saab,” came as much from the man as the machine he piloted to glory.</p>\n<hr class=\"mb-4 mt-4\">\n<h2 class=\"text-center text-xl font-bold mb-4 mt-4\">🧠 Driving Characteristics</h2>\n<p class=\"text-center\">Built for the brutal, the Saab 96 thrived where others failed. Its FWD layout gave superb traction on slippery roads, while its narrow frame made it agile through tight corners. The V4 engine gave it grunt without sacrificing balance, and the suspension soaked up rough terrain. Though not a high-speed beast, it was virtually unbreakable. </p>\n<hr class=\"mb-4 mt-4\">\n<h2 class=\"text-center text-xl font-bold mb-4 mt-4\">🔧 Legacy & Cultural Impact</h2>\n<p class=\"text-center\">The Saab 96 became synonymous with Scandinavian rallying. It put both Saab and Erik Carlsson on the motorsport map and proved that innovation and durability could compete with power and prestige. Even today, it’s remembered as one of the most iconic rally cars of its era — especially among winter and endurance rally enthusiasts.</p>",
