Colin McRae delivered a heroic performance in the harshest conditions imaginable — battling deep ruts, wildlife, dust, and relentless mechanical strain to claim a commanding win for Ford in one of the toughest rallies in the world.</p>\n<hr class=\"mb-4 mt-4\">\n<h2 class=\"text-center font-bold text-xl mb-4 mt-4\">🗺️ Route Details</h2>\n<p class=\"text-center\">Held across the wild landscapes around Nairobi, the Safari featured open-road competitive sections, long liaisons, and extreme endurance demands. Notable segments included:</p>\n<ul class=\"mt-2\">\n  <li><strong>Ngong Hills:</strong> Open plains with high-speed potential but hidden dangers — animals, washouts, and loose rock fields.</li>\n  <li><strong>Amboseli Zone:</strong> Hot, dry, and heavily rutted — challenged cooling systems and suspension setups.</li>\n  <li><strong>Elementaita:</strong> Fast sections with deep water crossings and unpredictable dust plumes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mt-4 text-center\">The average speed was significantly higher than typical rallies, but so were the consequences of mechanical failure or missed navigation.</p>\n<hr class=\"mb-4 mt-4\">\n<h2 class=\"text-center font-bold text-xl mb-4 mt-4\">🏆 Results</h2>\n<p><strong>Overall Winner:</strong> Colin McRae &amp; Nicky Grist (Ford Focus WRC)</p>\n<p><strong>2nd Place:</strong> Harri Rovanperä &amp; Risto Pietiläinen (Peugeot 206 WRC)</p>\n<p><strong>3rd Place:</strong> Didier Auriol &amp; Denis Giraudet (Peugeot 206 WRC)</p>\n<p class=\"mt-4 text-center\">McRae took the lead early and maintained it through a combination of speed and careful preservation. Peugeot’s drivers pushed hard but lost time to mechanical issues and navigation troubles in the treacherous terrain.</p>\n<hr class=\"mb-4 mt-4\">\n<h2 class=\"text-center font-bold text-xl mb-4 mt-4\">🚗 Vehicle Highlights</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Ford Focus WRC:</strong> Ruggedized for Safari use — reinforced suspension and added cooling ducts proved essential to survival and success.</li>\n  <li><strong>Peugeot 206 WRC:</strong> Light and fast, but less tolerant to the Safari’s abuse — both Rovanperä and Auriol showed pace but faced repairs.</li>\n  <li><strong>Mitsubishi Lancer Evo VI:</strong> Struggled with mechanical issues and failed to match the pace or resilience of its rivals.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr class=\"mb-4 mt-4\">\n<h2 class=\"text-center font-bold text-xl mb-4 mt-4\">🧭 Navigation and Challenges</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Open Road Format:</strong> No pace notes — drivers relied on road books and co-driver guidance in real time over vast distances.</li>\n  <li><strong>Wildlife &amp; Hazards:</strong> Animals, local traffic, and terrain damage all contributed to the Safari’s unmatched unpredictability.</li>\n  <li><strong>Mechanical Endurance:</strong> Punctures, overheating, and suspension failure were constant threats — only the most durable cars made it to the end.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mt-4 text-center\">McRae’s victory in Kenya was not just another win — it was a farewell to one of the sport’s most iconic events, and a reminder that endurance, patience, and raw skill are sometimes the only ways to conquer the wildest rally on Earth.</p>",

    "details_html": "\n<h2 class=\"text-center text-xl font-bold mb-4\">🏁 Overview</h2>\n<p><strong>Event Name:</strong> 2005 Wales Rally GB (United Kingdom)</p>\n<p><strong>Date:</strong> September 16–18, 2005</p>\n<p><strong>Start Location:</strong> Cardiff, Wales</p>\n<p><strong>Finish Location:</strong> Cardiff, Wales</p>\n<p><strong>Total Distance:</strong> ~1,120 km (estimated full route)</p>\n<p><strong>Competitive Stages:</strong> 355.30 km</p>\n<p><strong>Surface:</strong> Gravel (wet, muddy, forest)</p>\n<p class=\"mt-4 text-center\">In classic Welsh conditions — rain, mist, and deep forest mud — Petter Solberg broke Sébastien Loeb’s run of victories with a determined and precise performance. The win was especially meaningful, not just for Solberg’s season, but for co-driver Phil Mills, who celebrated the win in front of his home fans.</p>\n<hr class=\"mb-4 mt-4\">\n<h2 class=\"text-center font-bold text-xl mb-4 mt-4\">🗺️ Route Details</h2>\n<p class=\"text-center\">Held in the fast, flowing forestry roads of South and Mid Wales, the rally delivered its usual mix of fog and treacherous grip levels. Key stages included:</p>\n<ul class=\"mt-2\">\n  <li><strong>Myherin:</strong> Long and technical, combining wide gravel tracks with fast elevation changes and changing surfaces.</li>\n  <li><strong>Sweet Lamb:</strong> One of the rally’s signature stages — known for water splashes, jumps, and large crowds.</li>\n  <li><strong>Hafren:</strong> Deep forest stage — long, winding, and often shrouded in fog with slick surfaces and high-speed corners.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mt-4 text-center\">Heavy rain created mud-rutted lines and poor visibility, but Solberg’s smooth inputs and tire choice decisions kept him clear of mistakes.</p>\n<hr class=\"mb-4 mt-4\">\n<h2 class=\"text-center font-bold text-xl mb-4 mt-4\">🏆 Results</h2>\n<p><strong>Overall Winner:</strong> Petter Solberg &amp; Phil Mills (Subaru Impreza WRC)</p>\n<p><strong>2nd Place:</strong> Sébastien Loeb &amp; Daniel Elena (Citroën Xsara WRC)</p>\n<p><strong>3rd Place:</strong> Marcus Grönholm &amp; Timo Rautiainen (Peugeot 307 WRC)</p>\n<p class=\"mt-4 text-center\">Solberg took control from the early stages and held his lead with flawless execution. Loeb, focused on championship management, pushed just enough to secure second. Grönholm completed the podium but struggled with tire wear in the slick conditions.</p>\n<hr class=\"mb-4 mt-4\">\n<h2 class=\"text-center font-bold text-xl mb-4 mt-4\">🚗 Vehicle Highlights</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Subaru Impreza WRC:</strong> Excellent in muddy and wet forest settings — Solberg’s car handled with confidence and provided critical traction.</li>\n  <li><strong>Citroën Xsara WRC:</strong> Competitive but more nervous in deep ruts — Loeb drove smart and avoided risks.</li>\n  <li><strong>Peugeot 307 WRC:</strong> Struggled to maintain grip on soaked gravel — Grönholm lost time in longer stages due to rear-end instability.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr class=\"mb-4 mt-4\">\n<h2 class=\"text-center font-bold text-xl mb-4 mt-4\">🧭 Navigation and Challenges</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Fog and Darkness:</strong> Some stages were run in near-zero visibility — co-driver timing and total trust in pacenotes were essential.</li>\n  <li><strong>Waterlogged Surfaces:</strong> Rain softened the base, creating slick mud and rutting — wrong tire choices could cost minutes.</li>\n  <li><strong>Fatigue and Focus:</strong> The physical and mental toll of three long legs in poor weather tested even the most seasoned crews.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mt-4 text-center\">Solberg’s triumph in Wales was a critical morale boost — and a reminder that in tough conditions, raw pace and heart still win rallies. The crowd roared for Mills and Solberg as they stood atop the podium — soaked, muddy, and victorious.</p>",

    "details_html": "\n<h2 class=\"text-center text-xl font-bold mb-4\">🏁 Overview</h2>\n<p><strong>Event Name:</strong> 2005 Rallye de France – Tour de Corse (France)</p>\n<p><strong>Date:</strong> October 21–23, 2005</p>\n<p><strong>Start Location:</strong> Ajaccio, Corsica, France</p>\n<p><strong>Finish Location:</strong> Ajaccio, Corsica, France</p>\n<p><strong>Total Distance:</strong> ~1,000 km (estimated full route)</p>\n<p><strong>Competitive Stages:</strong> 341.36 km</p>\n<p><strong>Surface:</strong> Asphalt (technical, twisty)</p>\n<p class=\"mt-4 text-center\">On the tight, twisty tarmac of Corsica, Sébastien Loeb achieved what no WRC driver had done before — he won every single stage of a rally. The 2005 Tour de Corse was the ultimate demonstration of asphalt dominance, as Loeb and Daniel Elena turned in a flawless, untouchable performance across the mountainous Mediterranean island roads.</p>\n<hr class=\"mb-4 mt-4\">\n<h2 class=\"text-center font-bold text-xl mb-4 mt-4\">🗺️ Route Details</h2>\n<p class=\"text-center\">Corsica’s reputation as the 'Rally of 10,000 Corners' was well-earned — it demanded total focus and rhythm across its technical stages. Key stages included:</p>\n<ul class=\"mt-2\">\n  <li><strong>Pont de Castirla – Scala di Santa Regina:</strong> Narrow and unrelenting — carved into cliffside rock faces with no room for error.</li>\n  <li><strong>Erbajolo – Pont d'Altiani:</strong> A mix of high-speed tarmac and tight hairpins, with severe elevation changes.</li>\n  <li><strong>La Porta – Valle di Rostino:</strong> Twisty, cambered, and punishing for inconsistent brake or steering input.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mt-4 text-center\">Loeb’s commitment, tire selection, and surgical pace made him unbeatable. Other contenders faltered or simply couldn't keep up, as he opened gaps on every stage.</p>\n<hr class=\"mb-4 mt-4\">\n<h2 class=\"text-center font-bold text-xl mb-4 mt-4\">🏆 Results</h2>\n<p><strong>Overall Winner:</strong> Sébastien Loeb &amp; Daniel Elena (Citroën Xsara WRC)</p>\n<p><strong>2nd Place:</strong> Toni Gardemeister &amp; Jakke Honkanen (Ford Focus RS WRC)</p>\n<p><strong>3rd Place:</strong> Gilles Panizzi &amp; Hervé Panizzi (Skoda Fabia WRC)</p>\n<p class=\"mt-4 text-center\">Gardemeister drove smart and consistent to secure second, while Panizzi’s podium in the Skoda was one of the highlights of the marque’s WRC tenure. But it was Loeb’s complete stage sweep that defined the event and stunned the rallying world.</p>\n<hr class=\"mb-4 mt-4\">\n<h2 class=\"text-center font-bold text-xl mb-4 mt-4\">🚗 Vehicle Highlights</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Citroën Xsara WRC:</strong> The ultimate asphalt weapon — its braking, cornering, and torque delivery were flawless under Loeb’s command.</li>\n  <li><strong>Ford Focus RS WRC:</strong> Stable and predictable — Gardemeister couldn’t match Loeb’s pace but made no mistakes.</li>\n  <li><strong>Skoda Fabia WRC:</strong> Strong tarmac showing — Panizzi used his asphalt skills to maximum effect on Corsica’s precision-demanding roads.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr class=\"mb-4 mt-4\">\n<h2 class=\"text-center font-bold text-xl mb-4 mt-4\">🧭 Navigation and Challenges</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Corner Density:</strong> Constant direction changes punished inconsistency — Loeb’s timing and precision were in a class of their own.</li>\n  <li><strong>Brake Management:</strong> High-speed to hairpin transitions made brake fade a major threat — Loeb’s technique preserved tire and brake health.</li>\n  <li><strong>Fatigue:</strong> Even short mistakes meant disaster in Corsica — Loeb remained calm, clean, and utterly focused.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mt-4 text-center\">The 2005 Tour de Corse wasn’t just a rally win — it was history in the making. Loeb’s complete stage sweep has never been repeated, and it stands as one of the greatest drives in World Rally Championship history.</p>",
