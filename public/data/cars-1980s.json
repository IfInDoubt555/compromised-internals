    "details_html": "\n<h2 class=\"text-center text-xl font-bold mb-4\">🏁 Overview</h2>\n<p class=\"text-center\">Introduced in 1980, the Renault 5 Turbo was a radical reinterpretation of the humble hatchback. Renault relocated the engine behind the driver, added a turbocharger, and converted the drivetrain to rear-wheel drive — creating one of the most unique and exciting rally cars of the decade. Built to compete in Group 4 and later adapted to Group B, the 5 Turbo carved out a niche on twisty asphalt rallies, where its agility and brutal power delivery made it a fan favorite and a serious contender.</p>\n<hr class=\"mb-4 mt-4\">\n<h2 class=\"text-center text-xl font-bold mb-4 mt-4\">⚙️ Technical Specs & Innovations</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Engine:</strong> 1.4L turbocharged inline-4</li>\n  <li><strong>Power Output:</strong> ~270–320 hp (rally trim)</li>\n  <li><strong>Drivetrain:</strong> Rear-wheel drive</li>\n  <li><strong>Weight:</strong> ~970 kg (2,138 lbs)</li>\n  <li><strong>Layout:</strong> Mid-engine, wide-body hatchback (based on Renault 5)</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mt-4 text-center\">Unlike the AWD monsters of Group B, the Renault 5 Turbo relied on raw agility, low weight, and an aggressive rear-driven setup. Its compact size made it deadly on tight, twisty mountain passes and narrow rally stages.</p>\n<hr class=\"mb-4 mt-4\">\n<h2 class=\"text-center text-xl font-bold mb-4 mt-4\">🏆 Competitive Highlights</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>1981 Rallye Monte Carlo:</strong> Jean Ragnotti shocks the field with a dominant overall win.</li>\n  <li><strong>1982–1984 French & European Rallies:</strong> Frequent class wins on tarmac stages across Corsica, Spain, and Portugal.</li>\n  <li><strong>Group B Years:</strong> Upgraded to Turbo 2 and Maxi Turbo variants, specializing in asphalt rounds.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mt-4 text-center\">Though not a gravel or snow contender, the 5 Turbo was nearly unbeatable on asphalt when in the right hands. Its Monte Carlo victory remains one of the most iconic upsets in WRC history.</p>\n<hr class=\"mb-4 mt-4\">\n<h2 class=\"text-center text-xl font-bold mb-4 mt-4\">🧠 Driving Characteristics</h2>\n<p class=\"text-center\">The Renault 5 Turbo was tail-happy, twitchy, and incredibly fun — but also unforgiving. With the engine mounted in the rear and all power sent to the rear wheels, drivers had to manage throttle oversteer and turbo lag with precision. It required quick reflexes, bravery, and a deep understanding of momentum driving. For those who mastered it, the payoff was incredible precision through hairpins and mountain roads.</p>\n<hr class=\"mb-4 mt-4\">\n<h2 class=\"text-center text-xl font-bold mb-4 mt-4\">🔧 Legacy & Cultural Impact</h2>\n<p class=\"text-center\">The Renault 5 Turbo has become a cult classic — a poster child for creative engineering in the golden era of rallying.
