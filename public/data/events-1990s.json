Mastering the balance between slick asphalt and icy corners, Sainz and co-driver Luis Moya delivered a composed and strategic performance, claiming victory ahead of asphalt specialists on one of rallying’s most iconic stages.</p>\n<hr class=\"mb-4 mt-4\">\n<h2 class=\"text-center font-bold text-xl mb-4 mt-4\">🗺️ Route Details</h2>\n<p class=\"text-center\">As always, Monte Carlo’s stages were unpredictable and demanding, including legendary routes such as:</p>\n<ul class=\"mt-2\">\n  <li><strong>Col de Turini:</strong> A snowy, narrow mountain pass with high elevation and treacherous ice patches.</li>\n  <li><strong>St. Jean en Royans:</strong> Fast and clean asphalt in the dry, with slick zones in shaded corners and tunnels.</li>\n  <li><strong>Col de la Couillole:</strong> Long ascents and descents with mixed surfaces — a strategic minefield for tire choice.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mt-4 text-center\">Frequent microclimate changes along the mountain roads meant grip could shift drastically within a few kilometers, forcing split tire setups and conservative pace strategies.</p>\n<hr class=\"mb-4 mt-4\">\n<h2 class=\"text-center font-bold text-xl mb-4 mt-4\">🏆 Results</h2>\n<p><strong>Overall Winner:</strong> Carlos Sainz &amp; Luis Moya (Toyota Corolla WRC)</p>\n<p><strong>2nd Place:</strong> Juha Kankkunen &amp; Juha Repo (Ford Escort WRC)</p>\n<p><strong>3rd Place:</strong> Bruno Thiry &amp; Stéphane Prévot (Ford Escort WRC)</p>\n<p class=\"mt-4 text-center\">Sainz’s clean and calm approach paid off, as rivals faltered with poor tire choices and offs. The victory also gave Toyota its first win with the new Corolla WRC platform.</p>\n<hr class=\"mb-4 mt-4\">\n<h2 class=\"text-center font-bold text-xl mb-4 mt-4\">🚗 Vehicle Highlights</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Toyota Corolla WRC:</strong> In its competitive debut, the car showed balanced weight distribution and dependable grip on mixed surfaces, proving itself against more established machinery.</li>\n  <li><strong>Ford Escort WRC:</strong> Solid and predictable on asphalt, but not as adaptable to Monte Carlo’s sudden grip changes as the Toyota.</li>\n  <li><strong>Subaru Impreza WRC98:</strong> Competitive early on, but lost time due to misjudged tire strategies and setup limitations in low-grip sections.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr class=\"mb-4 mt-4\">\n<h2 class=\"text-center font-bold text-xl mb-4 mt-4\">🧭 Navigation and Challenges</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Mixed Surface Grip:</strong> Drivers faced constant transitions from dry asphalt to icy corners, often with no warning.</li>\n  <li><strong>Tire Strategy:</strong> Monte Carlo’s signature challenge — choosing between full snow, intermediates, or a mixed set — shaped every stage.</li>\n  <li><strong>Co-Driver Accuracy:</strong> Blind corners, snowbanks, and rhythm-breaking turns made precise pace notes essential.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mt-4 text-center\">The 1998 Monte Carlo Rally was a chess match of tire gambles and clean execution. Sainz’s calculated pace brought Toyota a triumphant debut and laid the groundwork for a strong championship push.</p>",

Didier Auriol, better known for his prowess on asphalt, drove flawlessly across the demanding gravel roads of Córdoba province to claim an unexpected but well-earned win in the Toyota Corolla WRC. His victory came through a mix of pace, preservation, and perfect tire choices in the unpredictable conditions.</p>\n<hr class=\"mb-4 mt-4\">\n<h2 class=\"text-center font-bold text-xl mb-4 mt-4\">🗺️ Route Details</h2>\n<p class=\"text-center\">The stages were based around Villa Carlos Paz, featuring a variety of rugged and narrow tracks through mountain ranges and valleys.

With his final victory, he reminded the world why he remains one of the sport’s true legends.</p>",
